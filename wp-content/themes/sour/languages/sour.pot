msgid ""
"Sour is a fresh new WordPress theme. It has a fresh new color scheme, fresh "
"new fonts, and a clean, but still fresh, style. Sour is also lightning fast "
"and so highly customizable that you can use it on all types of sites, from "
"blogs and photography websites to portfolios and e-commerce (WooCommerce) "
"shops. No matter how you use it, its freshness never wears off. And we don't "
"even have to mention how lightweight, SEO-optimized, or responsive it is. "
"What we will mention, however, is that Sour, being a child theme of Kahuna, "
"has already been translated into over 15 languages and is also RTL-ready. "
"Sour is fresh, like a cool smoothie on a hot summer afternoon. Sour- it's "
"actually pretty sweet!"
